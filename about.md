I solve complex security problems that require custom engineering solutions, from technical analysis through design to implementation.

With over 17 years of experience, combining technical depth with leadership experience, and with a strong track record of driving forward-looking security initiatives in both research and applied settings, I have delivered advanced, highly customized security solutions across a range of domains.

My background includes leading security teams, securing distributed Edge, malware analysis, reverse engineering, vulnerability research, exploit development, and the architecture and development of bespoke tools.

I'm  currently focused on the design and implementation of strategic security technologies in distributed Edge systems, working on Linux Foundation backed open-source projects like [EVE OS](https://github.com/lf-edge/eve), TPM Enhanced Authorization [library](https://github.com/lf-edge/eve-tpmea), and more. With particular interest in remote attestation, hardware-based security (TPM, HSM), ARM Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), and secure software design principles.

I can help enhance and automate security workflows, from vulnerability discovery to threat modeling and attack surface reduction.
