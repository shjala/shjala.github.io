I’ve put together some [slides](https://defense.sh/assets/img/posts/sre/sre.pdf) on how we used to do security requirement engineering at Mbition. The approach builds on threat modeling as the main activity for eliciting security requirements [1,2,3], uses EARS [4] for specification, and relies on a modified Volere [5] template for documentation. A key idea is to write reusable security requirements [6,7], gradually building up a security requirements repository that can support future projects.
