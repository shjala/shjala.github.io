Every once in a while, a casual “Challenge accepted” conversation with a friend turns into an unexpected little project. This one of those!

I decided to play around with text steganography, and by combining Kashida [1] and White-Space I manage tto tuck secret bits into ordinary-looking text. Now, to be clear, this isn’t some top-secret tool. There’s no encryption, no steganography key, and no real security features here. It’s purely a toy project, built for the fun of the idea itself.

If you’re curious to see it in action, check out the live version [here](https://steganography.page.gd/) and source code [here](https://github.com/shjala/text-steg).
